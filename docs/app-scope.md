## The App‚Äôs Scope

Think of your app as divided into two major sections:

1. **Global Pages** ‚Äî where users explore, manage, or access multiple inventories.
2. **Inventory Pages** ‚Äî everything _inside_ one inventory (the tabs you‚Äôve already built).

The **global pages** handle _who can access what_, while the **inventory pages** handle _what‚Äôs inside_ that inventory.

### üß≠ Example ‚ÄúDashboard / My Inventories‚Äù Page

- Table 1: _Inventories You Own_
- Table 2: _Inventories You Can Access_ (as Editor/Viewer)
- Each row has:

  - Inventory Title
  - Category
  - Description
  - Role (Owner/Editor/Viewer)
  - Actions ‚Üí View / Edit / Delete

üß© Clicking ‚ÄúView‚Äù opens the **Inventory Layout** with relevant tabs.
(You already built that part ‚Äî you‚Äôll just conditionally lock certain tabs based on the user‚Äôs role.)

## üß± 2Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Pages (Inside One Inventory)

These are the tabs you‚Äôve been working on ‚Äî now let‚Äôs map them clearly.

| Tab                | Path                           | Purpose                                                        | Who Can Access                |

## üîí Access Rules Inside Inventory Tabs

| Role       | Permissions                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Full access to all tabs (can edit, delete, manage access).                                  |
| **Editor** | Can add/edit items, comment, view stats. Cannot access settings, fields, or access control. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to items, discussion (no posting), and statistics.                         |

You‚Äôll basically reuse your **tab layout** and **route structure**,
and just hide or disable certain tabs depending on the user‚Äôs `role`.
