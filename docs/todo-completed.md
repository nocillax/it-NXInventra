1. Login-logout implemented with proper API integrations
   -translation for login page remaining
2. Profile page implemented with proper API integrations and CRUD workss!
3. Inventory pages render correctly, create inventory works perfectly (except the tags case stuffs)
4. the inventory folder structure for frontend is perfect - try to replicate it elsewhere as well
5. inventory-settings page done!
6. custom-id works!

## npx shadcn@latest add @shadcn-editor/markdown-plugin ->use this for markdown everywhere!

## when an inventory does not have id, if i try to validate it - throws 500 error

## when same gmail but diff provider exist - error while login!

## need to make the tags case insensitive and make sure they are stored in lowercase.

## merge the hooks so each one has one hook

## there seems to be a limit=20 in tagService - this might mean not all tags are going to be used in autocomplete! remove this limit!

## duplicate fieldname inside one inventory cannot happen

7. access page works properly!!
8. discussion page works perfectly with markdown as well!
9. items crud works nicely. (need to add tooltip more)
10. global search done
11.
