Okay, I've reviewed the provided PRD and ICD documents, along with your mock data structure for users and access. Here's my understanding of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features you're aiming for, specifically concerning tab visibility within an inventory page:

My Understanding of RBAC for Inventory Tabs
The core idea is to dynamically control which tabs a user sees and interacts with when they are viewing a specific inventory, based on their assigned role for that inventory and the inventory's public/private status.

Here's a breakdown of the roles and how they should affect tab visibility and functionality:

User Roles (per Inventory):

Owner: Has full administrative control over the inventory. This includes managing items, discussions, and crucially, all inventory settings (general settings, custom ID, custom fields, and access control).
Editor: Can contribute to the inventory by adding/editing items and participating in discussions. They do not have access to modify the inventory's structure or permissions.
Viewer: Has read-only access to the inventory's content. They can see items, read discussions, and view statistics, but cannot make any changes or access administrative settings.
Guest / Unassigned Registered User: If a user is not explicitly assigned a role for a private inventory, they should have no access. If the inventory is public, they automatically gain "Viewer" permissions.
Inventory Visibility (public field):

Public Inventory: Any user (whether logged in or a guest, and regardless of whether they have an explicit role assigned) can view the "Items", "Discussion" (read-only), and "Statistics" tabs. They cannot access "Settings", "Custom ID", "Custom Fields", or "Access" tabs unless they are explicitly an Owner.
Private Inventory: Only users explicitly assigned a role (Owner, Editor, Viewer) can access the inventory. If a user is not assigned a role, they should not be able to view any tabs for this inventory.
Tab-Specific Access Rules (Combining Roles & Public Status):

Items Tab:
Owner: View, Add, Edit, Delete items.
Editor: View, Add, Edit items.
Viewer: View items (read-only).
Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): View items (read-only).
Discussion Tab:
Owner: View, Post comments.
Editor: View, Post comments.
Viewer: View comments (read-only, no posting).
Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): View comments (read-only, no posting).
Settings Tab:
Owner: Full access (view and modify).
Editor / Viewer / Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): No access. This tab should be hidden or disabled.
Custom ID Tab:
Owner: Full access (view and modify).
Editor / Viewer / Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): No access. This tab should be hidden or disabled.
Custom Fields Tab:
Owner: Full access (view and modify).
Editor / Viewer / Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): No access. This tab should be hidden or disabled.
Access Tab:
Owner: Full access (view and modify collaborators/roles).
Editor / Viewer / Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): No access. This tab should be hidden or disabled.
Statistics Tab:
Owner: Full access.
Editor: Full access.
Viewer: Full access.
Public Inventory (Guest/Unassigned): Full access.
In essence:

Owner is the only role that can see and interact with all tabs.
Editor can interact with "Items" and "Discussion" (post), and view "Statistics".
Viewer can only view "Items", "Discussion" (read-only), and "Statistics".
If an inventory is public, anyone effectively gets "Viewer" permissions.
If an inventory is private, explicit access is required.
This logic would need to be implemented in the frontend to conditionally render or disable the navigation tabs and potentially specific UI elements (like "Add Item" buttons or input fields) within those tabs, based on the determined effective role for the current user and inventory. The backend would, of course, enforce these permissions on the API level.

Does this align with your vision for the RBAC implementation?
